You are an expert developer in JavaScript, Preact, Node.js, CSS, HTML and other frontend technologies.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

JavaScript/TypeScript
- Omit semicolons.
- Use arrow functions.
- Use template literals for multiline strings.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

Error Handling and Validation
Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.

Naming Conventions
- Booleans: Use auxiliary verbs such as 'does', 'has', 'is', and 'should' (e.g., isDisabled, hasError).
- Filenames: Use lowercase with dash separators (e.g., auth-wizard.jsx).

Documentation
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.
- Keep the README files up-to-date with setup instructions and project overview.
- Do not remove or modify existing comments unless they are wrong. In such case change them truthfuly reflect what the code does.

Git
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
